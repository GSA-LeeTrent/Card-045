Title:
Assign MGS Vacancy PAR Number Organizations using UDFs

Description:
As an HR QMS user I want the Organization of my team's Vacancy PAR Number Missing Errors 
to be set using the Vacancy User Defined field using the "HR Spec Assigned Branch" 
so that the QMS issue stays with the organization that owns the Vacancy Announcement


Acceptance Criteria:
1. For Vacancy Announcement PAR Number Missing Errors - use the HR Spec Assigned Branch in the Vacancy UDFs 
	so that we make sure it stays with the organization that owns the Vacancy instead of whereever the user may or may not be

2. Same processing for Vacancy Announcement PAR Number Format errors - use the same UDF

A mapping may need to exist from the UDF value to the QMS organization if they are spelled slightly different.


Reproduce Steps:
To test...
Find an Announcement where the HR Manager field is someone not in QMS
Check the QMS issue - ensure that the Organization is set to the value of the UDF
